# OVAD - overload as you like  
  
OVAD (OVerloAD) is a Python package, that allows seamless overloading methods / functions on arbitrary arguments either in Java-style or Python-style manner.  
The name phonetically reassembles the Polish word "owad", which means insect. Why this name? Pure coincidence between set of phonetics of possible acronyms of "ovelroad" and Polish language.
  
It is better than Python's build-in singledispatch, as you can have arbitrarily complex signatures.  
It is better than third-party's multipledispatch, as you can declare arbitrary types as annotations, moreover with less boilerplate.  
  
## Installation  
  
```shell
pip install ovad
```  
  
No dependencies. Python >=3.10.
